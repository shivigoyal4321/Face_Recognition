# Facial_Recognition

ABOUT THIS PROJECT:
Face Recognition Attendance System is a Python-based real-time application that uses a webcam to recognize known faces and automatically record attendance. Built with OpenCV and face_recognition, it detects and identifies individuals from a preloaded set of images, then logs their names and timestamps into a dated CSV file. This project demonstrates practical use of computer vision and facial recognition for automation in classrooms, offices, or access control systems.

HOW DOES THIS PROJECT WORK:
Loads 2 known faces: for example i used pictures with name = Harry and Larry

Starts the webcam on execution, show those known faces

Recognizes those faces in real-time

Displays their names on screen and

Marks attendance by writing their names and timestamps into a CSV file

If unknown face is shown, it displays
